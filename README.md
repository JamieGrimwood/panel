# Jexactyl
Jexactyl is based off of Pterodactyl Panel, which is an open-source 
game server management panel built with PHP 8 and React. 
Designed with security in mind, Pterodactyl runs all game servers 
in isolated Docker containers while exposing a beautiful 
and intuitive UI to end users.

Stop settling for less. Make game servers a first class citizen on your platform.
